Dollar Value of a basis point = DV01
is a measure of how the price of a bond changes in response to a change in yield. 

It is also known as the present value of one basis point = PV01


Value at Risk = vm (vi / v(i - 1))
M = the number of days from which historical data is taken
vi = the number of variables on the day i. 


Confidence	# of σ	Calculation	Equals
95% (high)	- 1.65 x σ	- 1.65 x (2.64%) =	-4.36%
99% (really high)	- 2.33 x σ	- 2.33 x (2.64%) =	-6.15%



Volatility = σ√T
where:

σ = standard deviation of returns
T = number of periods in the time horizon



Find the mean of the data set.
Calculate the difference between each data value and the mean.
Square the deviations. This will eliminate negative values.
Add the squared deviations together.
Divide the sum of the squared deviations (82.5) by the number of data values.

Take the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation
